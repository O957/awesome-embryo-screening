# Awesome Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

_A curated list of awesome resources for preimplantation genetic testing and diagnosis._

<details markdown=1>

<summary> Definition From Wikipedia </summary>

> **Preimplantation genetic diagnosis** (**PGD** or **PIGD**) is the [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetics "Human genetics") profiling of [embryos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo "Embryo") prior to implantation (as a form of [embryo profiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_profiling "Embryo profiling")), [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis#cite_note-1)] and sometimes even of [oocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte "Oocyte") prior to [fertilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation "Fertilisation"). PGD is considered in a similar fashion to [prenatal diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis "Prenatal diagnosis"). When used to screen for a specific [genetic disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disease "Genetic disease"), its main advantage is that it avoids selective [abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion "Abortion"), as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to [assisted reproductive technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology "Assisted reproductive technology"), and requires [in vitro fertilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation "In vitro fertilisation") (IVF) to obtain [oocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocytes "Oocytes") or embryos for evaluation. Embryos are generally obtained through [blastomere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastomere "Blastomere") or [blastocyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocyst "Blastocyst") [biopsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy "Biopsy"). The latter technique has proved to be less deleterious for the embryo, therefore it is advisable to perform the biopsy around day 5 or 6 of development.
